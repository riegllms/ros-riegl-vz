# ROS2 RIEGL VZ Package API

## 1. Coordinate Systems

**SOCS** (Scanner's Own Coordinate System):  

Angle data and range data are the base for calculation of the data in the Scanner’s Own Coordinate System (SOCS).

![SOCS (Scanner's Own Coordinate System)](img/socs.png)

**PRCS** (Project Coordinate System):  

A number of scan positions and the data acquired therein make up a scan project. The center of the project’s coordinate system (PRCS) coincides horizontally with the center of the first scan position. The axes of PRCS are strictly pointing to east (x-axis, red), north (y-axis, green) and up (z-axis, blue), respectively.

The SOP transforms SOCS into PRCS.

![PRCS (Project Coordinate System)](img/prcs.png)

**GLCS** (Global Coordinate System):

A global coordinate system like WGS84.

The POP transforms GLCS into PRCS

**VOCS** (Voxel Coordinate System):  

Automatic registration does not estimate the SOP with every new scan position, but the SOPV pose, which does not transform to PRCS, but to another cartesian coordinate system, the so called VOCS (Voxel Coordinate System). A once determined SOPV pose stays unchanged. What changes is the VOP. The VOP pose is determined via compensation of a fixed block of registered scan positions against all further measurements. Further measurements are the scanners inclination, northing from internal magnitude sensor, which is fraught with great uncertainty, and GNSS position if available.  

After first scan: VOP = eye(4)  
After each consecutive scan: VOP <> eye(4)  

If the user is only interested in relative registration of scan positions to each other, the VOP and the POP can be ignored.

#### 3.1.2 Published Topics

**pointcloud** ([sensor_msgs/PointCloud2](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2.msg)) :

Point cloud with scan data from the laser scanner.Data will be published only if parameter '~scan_publish' is enabled. The pointcloud data includes following data fields:  

```

```

**voxels** (riegl_vz_interfaces/Voxels) :

Voxel data for current scan position. Data will be published only if parameter '~scan_register' and '~voxel_publish' are enabled. The pointcloud data includes following data fields:  

```
float64 x, y, z               : Cartesian point coordinates in 'riegl_vz_vocs' coordinate system
float32 r                     : Target surface reflectance in dB

```

**pose** ([geometry_msgs/PoseStamped](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped.msg)):

Topic provides SOPV (Scan Position and Orientation in VOCS) of the currently registered scan position.

**pose_fast** ([geometry_msgs/PoseStamped](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/geometry_msgs/msg/PoseStamped.msg)):

Actual GNSS fix with position in WGS84 coordinates (EPSG::4979). If the gnss receiver provides coordinates in another coordinate system, they are automatically transformed to WGS84 by means of the GeoSys service in the scanner. If coordinate transformation fails because the required database in '/media/internal/gsm.gsfx' is missing or does not contain the required information, the coordinates will be set to 0 each.

**diagnostics** ([diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray.msg](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/diagnostic_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray.msg)):

Riegl VZ status information, published once per second:

```
scanner:
  opstate       : operating state ("unavailable", "waiting", "scanning", "processing")
  active_task   : active task description
  task_error    : error of background task
  progress      : scan progress in percent
  scan_position : number of current scan position

```

#### 3.1.3 Services

**set_project** ([std_srvs/Trigger](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.srv)) :

Load an existing project on the scanner with name from parameter '~project_name'. If the project name is empty or the project can not be loaded, a new project will be created automatically.

Response:  
success = True -> message: Project Name  

**scan** ([std_srvs/Trigger](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.srv)) :

Start a background task for laser scan data acquisition.

The execution state of the background task will be published in 'opstate' field of 'diagnostics' topic.  
The node is locked until all background tasks have finished and the operating state is 'waiting' again.  
If an error occurs, the 'task_error' field of 'diagnostics' topic will show an error message (e.g. 'scan registration failed').

If parameter '\~scan_publish' is enabled, acquired data will be published on 'pointcloud' topic soon after scanning has finished.

The parameter '\~scan_register' enables automatic scan position registration after scanning. The registration result is published on topic 'pose' and with TF2 broadcast messages (see 3.1.4).

The parameter '\~reflector_search' activates automatic search and scan of reflector targets.

The parameter '\~image_capture' enables automatic capturing of images with an external camera mounted on top of the laser scanner device.

Response:  
success = True -> message: "success"  
success = False -> message: "device not available" | "device is busy" | "command execution error"

![ROS Scan Service](img/scan.png)

**set_position** (riegl_vz_interfaces/SetPosition) :

Set position of the scanner origin. The position must be set before the scan has finished. This is used for scan registration without GNSS. Scanner orientation still comes from the scanner internal IMU and magnetic field sensor.

**set_pose** (riegl_vz_interfaces/SetPose) :

Set position and orientation from a robot with accurate kinematic sensors for example. The position and orientation must be set before the scan has finished. The behavior of the service call depends on the parameter 'relative_pose_mode'.  

relative_pose_mode = True: The driver calculates relative position and orientation changes from one scan position to the next. The resulting data is used for scanner position determination in the scan registration algorithm.  

relative_pose_mode = False: The driver uses the absolute positions and only the yaw angle from the orientation for scanner position determination in the scan registration algorithm.  

![Robot coordinate systems](img/robot_cs.png)

For absolute pose from a robot the driver needs:
- The scanner mounting position and orientation on the robot, which is the transformation from the robot body frame (robot_body_frame) to VZ scanner SOCS (robot_vz_socs). See parameter 'robot_scanner_mounting'.  
- A TF2 transformation available for coordinate transformation from robot to scanner project frame (robot_proj_frame -> riegl_vz_prcs). It is expected that 'set_pose' service call provides absolute positions and orientations in the robot project frame.

**get_scan_poses** (riegl_vz_interfaces/GetScanPoses) :

Request all positions and orientations of previously registered scans of the current project.

Response:  
success = True -> message: "success", project: Project Name, scanposes: All Scan Poses, vop: VOP Pose, pop: POP Pose  
success = False -> message: "device not available" | "command execution error"

**get_tpl** (riegl_vz_interfaces/GetTpl) :

Get a list of tie points (reflectors) of a previous scan position of the current project with configuration parameter '~reflector_search' activated.

Response:  
success = True -> message: "success", tpl: List of Tie Points  
success = False -> message: "device not available" | "command execution error"

**stop** ([std_srvs/Trigger](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.srv)) :

Stop laser scan data acquisition and registration background tasks.

Response:  
success = True -> message: "success"  
success = False -> message: "device not available" | "command execution error"

**shutdown** ([std_srvs/Trigger](https://github.com/ros2/common_interfaces/blob/master/std_srvs/srv/Trigger.srv)) :

Stop data acquisition and power down the laser scanner device.

Response:  
success = True -> message: "success"  
success = False -> message: "command execution error"

#### 3.1.4 TF2 Transformation

The node will broadcast TF2 transformation messages if an existing project is loaded and after each scan position registration:
